# Low-precision feature selection for wearables
This repository includes two main resources:

* Implementation of methods used in reduced precision.

* Ranking similarity results of each dataset.

## Codes
* mi_nfi.m: adaptation of the calculation of mutual information with support for fixed-point representation.

* nmytypes.m: possible fixed-point representations.

* MIM_nfi.m: implementation of selection method MIM with support for fixed-point representation.

* JMI_nfi.m: implementation of selection method JMI with support for fixed-point representation.

* mrmr_mid_d_nfi.m: implementation of selection method mRMR with support for fixed-point representation.

## Results
This folder contains the graphs with ranking similarity results for each combination of datasets and methods selected.
